#Neural Network Simulation

This project implements a simple artificial neural network with one hidden layer and one output layer using Python. The network uses the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function and random weight initialization.

##Overview

The network consists of:
Two input neurons (i1, i2)
Two hidden layer neurons (h1, h2)
Two output neurons (o1, o2)
Randomized weights initialized in the range (-0.5, 0.5)
Fixed biases (b1 = 0.5, b2 = 0.7)
Tanh activation function


##How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed, then execute the script using:
python script.py


##Possible Enhancements

Allow user-defined inputs instead of fixed values.
Improve weight initialization using more advanced techniques.
Extend the network for more complex tasks, such as classification.

##License

This project is open-source and available for modification and distribution.
